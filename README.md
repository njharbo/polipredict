# polipredict
This repo contains the code behind all pages and figures on polipredict.dk.

Website contains all html pages

Website/js contains a javascript file for each market. In top of file the data is downloaded from a google sheet. 

Suggestions for a new figure designs are very welcome! The only requirement is that they should be generated dynamically using the google sheet data. That is, the figures should be generated directly on the webpage. Not locally via R or other statistical packages. 

Happy coding!
